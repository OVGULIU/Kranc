1.0.1-cvs
=========

- Changed the default name for a function in an evaluator thorn to
  contain the thorn name.  Helps to avoid conflicts with other thorns.

- Fixed bug whereby the name of the calculation in an evaluator thorn
  was not used for the function name.

- Added "InheritedImplementations" option to all the Kranc thorns.

- Updated README for Cactus beta14

- Check the value of SetTimes for CreateSetterThorn, throw an error if
  the value is not allowed (otherwise, a typo in the option fails to
  create a schedule entry without any warning or error).

- Removed (historical) dependency on "Format" package

- Added symbols for "pow" and "exp" that used to be provided by the
  Format package

- Removed "External" directory from the paths of the examples

- Deleted obsolete global parameters from GenericFD (stencil widths)
