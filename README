Generating this site
====================

Since GitHub does not support standard server-side includes, this site
uses the Jekyll engine for page inclusion:

       https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki

Jekyll markup is automatically processed by GitHub when the page is
uploaded.  In order to test the site locally, you need to install
Jekyll:

     https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Install

To test the site, run

   jekyll --pygments --safe

in the root html directory.  The site will be generated in the _site directory.
