<h2>About</h2>

<p>Kranc is a <a href =
"http://www.wolfram.com/products/mathematica/index.html">Mathematica</a>
application which turns a tensorial description of a time dependent
partial differential equation into a module for the <a href =
"http://cactuscode.org">Cactus Computational Toolkit</a>.  It is
designed to take a simple continuum description of a problem and
generate highly efficient and portable code.  As such, it can be used
both for rapid prototyping of evolution systems and for high
performance supercomputing.</p>

<p>Kranc is free software distributed under the <a href =

Public License (GPL) (version 2)</a> for unrestricted use.  We request
that you cite our 2006 <a href =
"http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0404023">Kranc paper</a> if you use Kranc,
or Kranc-generated code, in a scientific publication. Note that Kranc
has evolved significantly since the version described in the paper,
both in usability and functionality.</p>

<p>Kranc was originally written by Sascha Husa, Ian Hinder, Christiane
Lechner and is now actively developed by Ian Hinder, Erik Schnetter
and Barry Wardell.</p>
